This is a simple vscode extension used for previewing your html elements while hovering.
Currently made for html files only.

>[!NOTE]
This is still in beta, currently this extension will create a temp file in your working directory to render the html (called `.hoverpreview.temp.html`), we'll soon change that. Please refer to [roadmap](roadmap.md)

## What is Hover preview?

We have all come across front-end codes that we don't understand because of lack of visual cues. Like the
one shown below

Now it can become overwhelming at first glance if you have no prior experience in the CSS library or framework used in the code. So to make it easier Hover Preview provides you with a quick preview of what it the element would look like in the browser.
