# Hover preview - VsCode extension [BETA] 
This is a simple vscode extension used for previewing your html elements while hovering.
Currently made for html files only.

>[!NOTE]
This is still in beta, currently this extension will create a temp file in your working directory to render the html (called `.hoverpreview.temp.html`), we'll soon change that. Please refer to [roadmap](roadmap.md)
