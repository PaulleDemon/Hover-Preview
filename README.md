# Hover preview - VsCode extension [BETA] 
This is a simple vscode extension used for previewing your html elements while hovering.

>[!NOTE]
This is still in beta, currently this extension will create a temp file in your working directory to render the html (called `.hoverpreview.temp.html`), we'll soon change that. Please refer to [roadmap](roadmap.md)

## Why use Hover preview?

Have you seen a code like this and gone, what does this even do???

well now you don't, cause hover preview will show you exactly what that renders in browser


## Roadmap

Please refer to [roadmap](roadmap.md) 

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.
